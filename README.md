# zap-analyzer

A cli that helps you sort through the results of an OWASP ZAP scan.

`zap-analyzer` helps you triage issues to help you focus your time chasing errors by identifying likely false positives. Ideally, the reports generated by `zap-analyzer` could be tuned to a specific framework or stack (e.g. Jekyll, Rails, and Django).

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Ruby or Docker

### Docker installation

Clone this repo and `cd` into it. Then build the image:

```
$ docker build -t zap-analyzer .
```

### Ruby installation

Clone this repo and `cd` into it. Then install the dependencies:

```
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

The data source for `zap-analyzer` are JSON files of OWASP ZAP output scans.

18F stores these files publicly on compliance-viewer-18f.gov. An example of one of these files can be found [here](https://compliance-viewer.18f.gov/results/micropurchase/current?format=json).

Pipe this JSON into the `zap-cli`:

## Docker usage

```
$ curl https://compliance-viewer.18f.gov/results/micropurchase/current?format=json | docker run -i zap-analyzer
```

If you want to write the report to a file:

```
$ curl https://compliance-viewer.18f.gov/results/micropurchase/current?format=json | docker run -i zap-analyzer > report.md
```

## Ruby usage

From the root of the `zap-analyzer` project folder:

```
$ curl https://compliance-viewer.18f.gov/results/micropurchase/current?format=json | bin/cli
```
